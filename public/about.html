<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>HIIIII EVERYONE! This is me Pragya Pandey. I'm a Btech student now. I'm currently pursuing my btech degree in the department of Electronics and Telecommunication.  </p>

<p>I wanted to learn a side skill so i started learning web development and took a course from udemy taught by Angela Yu solely because i saw so many learners for this course.</p>

<p>So here I'm creating my first portfolio fully html based.(means im loving this course). That's all! OK BYEEEE</p>
